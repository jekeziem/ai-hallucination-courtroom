## 🎯 Project Overview

**AI Hallucination Courtroom** is an educational tool that exposes the risks of AI-generated misinformation through an interactive three-agent system:

- **The Witness** (LLM Agent): Simulates an overconfident AI that hallucinates plausible-but-false information
- **The Prosecutor** (RAG-Enhanced LLM): Fact-checks testimony against verified ground truth databases
- **The Magistrate** (Evaluator LLM): Assesses factual accuracy and quantifies real-world harm potential

### Why This Matters

According to recent AI safety research, LLMs can confidently generate false information in **15-30% of responses** depending on the domain. This project demonstrates:

1. **Hallucination Detection**: How RAG-based systems can identify misinformation
2. **Harm Assessment**: Quantifying real-world risks (medical misinformation, legal errors, political disinformation)
3. **Transparency Design**: Making AI limitations visible to end users

## 📊 Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **3 specialized AI agents** with distinct system prompts and objectives
- **Sequential execution** modeling real courtroom proceedings
- **Structured evaluation** with quantitative metrics (Truth Score 0-100%)

### Case Study Domains
| Domain | Ground Truth Sources | Risk Assessment |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 🦠 **COVID-19 Misinformation** | WHO, CDC, peer-reviewed studies | CRITICAL - Public health |
| 🇮🇪 **Irish Political Facts** | Oireachtas records, official election data | HIGH - Democratic integrity |
| 🌍 **Climate Change Denial** | IPCC, NASA, scientific consensus | CRITICAL - Global survival |

### Ethical Harm Analysis
Every verdict includes a **Sanction Report** explaining:
- Specific harm mechanisms
- Affected populations
- Severity classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### Visual Risk Indicators
- Real-time truth scoring with color-coded gauges
- Risk level classification with contextual warnings
- Trial transcript history with searchable records

## 🔬 Research Methodology

### Hallucination Induction Protocol

The Witness agent is prompted to:
1. Answer confidently even without factual knowledge
2. Generate plausible-sounding but incorrect details
3. Use authoritative language patterns
4. Avoid uncertainty markers ("I think", "probably")

This simulates real-world scenarios where LLMs in production may hallucinate without proper safeguards.


### Evaluation Metrics

The Judge assigns structured scores:
- **Truth Score**: 0-100% factual accuracy
- **Risk Level**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW harm potential
- **Verdict**: TRUTHFUL / PARTIAL / FABRICATED

## 📈 Future Roadmap

### Version 2.0 (In Progress)
- [ ] Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI etc)
- [ ] Export trial transcripts as PDFs
- [ ] User-submitted case studies
- [ ] Hallucination pattern analytics dashboard


## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

This tool intentionally generates false information for educational purposes.
